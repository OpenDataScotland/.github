# Welcome to Open Data Scotland

We are a volunteer-led team working to create a directory of all open datasets across Scotland.

## Repository summaries

Looking to learn more about what repositories we have? Check out the information below!

### [the_od_bods](https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/the_od_bods)
The original repository that was set up off the back of this project starting at [Code The City 23](https://codethecity.org/2021/06/13/3689/) where we collated open datasets across local authorities in Scotland.

We now use this as our main repository for tracking project process, wiki documentation and scripting toolsets we use to scrape data for our website, [opendata.scot](https://opendata.scot)

### [jkan](https://github.com/OpenDataScotland/jkan)

A lightweight, backend-free open data portal, powered by Jekyll and originally created by [timwis](https://github.com/timwis)). This repository holds the source code we use to generate the static site pages for [opendata.scot](https://opendata.scot).
